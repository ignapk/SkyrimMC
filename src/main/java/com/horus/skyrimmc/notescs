if (event.getType() == RenderGameOverlayEvent.ElementType.CROSSHAIRS && mc.player.getHeldItemMainhand().getItem() instanceof ItemBow) {
  //event.setCanceled(true);
  event.setResult(Event.Result.Deny);
  renderCrosshair(rescaledWidth, rescaledHeight);
}

overlay event ElementType.CROSSHAIR ->cancel that, drawo your own in the event.Pre


renderOverlayEvent

protected void renderCrosshairs(float partialTicks) {
    if (pre(CROSSHAIRS)) return;
    bind(Gui.ICONS);
    GlStateManager.enableBlend();
    super.renderAttackIndicator(partialTicks, res);
    post(CROSSHAIRS);
}

fixed it - the issue was that i was trying to check for the event after I had arleady cancelled some others

GlStateManager.enableBlend in renderCrosshair!

nvm it was the fact im not drawing anything in renderCrosshair
